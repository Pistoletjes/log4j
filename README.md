## 7. Mitigation Guide
**! Imprtant !** Exploits are continously developed. Aways make sure to work with the **latest** version of scanners.

1. Identify potential vulnerable devices by using https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/blob/main/software/README.md - This a time consuming task, but you need to do it anyway, so better start quickly!

2. Run a scan to check for vulnerable java applications/dependancies using: https://github.com/mergebase/log4j-detector with command `java log4j-detector-2021.12.14.jar c:/` and watch for files that have been classified as vulnerable.

3. Run a scan to check for expoit attempts using https://github.com/Neo23x0/log4shell-detector `python3 log4shell-detector.py -p c:\` and wath for exploitation attempts.
