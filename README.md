This is a public repository from Wortell containing information, links, files and other items related to CVE-2021-44228.

## 1. Scanning

Here are a few options to try and find applications that use Log4j and could potentially be abused:

* BURP Pro add-in:
https://gist.github.com/kugg/0d08b6548db249eaffaca1799e0d01d6

* File scanner (obv Powershell, for Windows):
https://gist.github.com/Skons/0b9bbfbbf37d2707ccf83f3d549a6588

* File Scanner (obv Go, all platforms)
https://github.com/dtact/divd-2021-00038--log4j-scanner
(Will also disable JNDI, when found!)

* Log Scanner (It checks local log files for indicators of exploitation attempts)
https://github.com/Neo23x0/log4shell-detector

* Detects log4j versions on your file-system, including deeply recursively nested copies (jars inside jars inside jars). Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac, and everywhere else Java runs, too!
